# Bio
👨‍💻 Senior Fullstack Engineer | Go · React Native · AWS · Supabase

Experienced in building scalable backend systems with Go, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, and cloud-native architecture (AWS, Fly.io). I also develop full-featured mobile apps using React Native and Supabase, and integrate AI/LLM tools like OpenAI API and Langchain.

Previously focused on frontend and DX (React, TypeScript, GraphQL, Federation), and still bring that polish to UI-heavy projects.
Mentor, ex-lecturer at Kyiv Polytechnic, and obsessed with clean architecture, automation, and system design.
